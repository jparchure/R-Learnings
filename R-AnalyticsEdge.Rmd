##Linear Regression
* **Baseline Model**- A model with no variables, usually set as a measure of central tendency (Mean, median)

* **SSE**- Square Sum of Errors

* **SST**- Square Sum of Errors from Baseline Model

* **R<sup>2</sup>**- is the error difference from the Baseline model. <br>
Formula: R<sup>2</sup>** = 1 -(SSE/SST)

###Warning- SSE is not square root
<!--#Problems
#Hard to cmpare 2 models
#Good models for easy problems will
#have an R squared close to 1.
#But good models for hard problems
#can still have an R squared close to zero.
#Throughout this course we will see
#`examples of both types of problems.-->
